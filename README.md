### About

This repository is intended for practices on ARM processors, in this case, the ARMv7 family. The codes were tested in the <a href="https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc">CPUlator simulator</a>.

### Resources

A special folder that includes support materials related to the board and the processor, such as manuals for the Cortex-A9, for the board and for the GIC (Generic Interrupt Controller).
